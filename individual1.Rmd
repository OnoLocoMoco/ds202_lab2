Here is a histogram for the ratings of the Chocolate data set. It appears to be left-skewed. 
```{r }
hist(choco$Rating)
boxplot(choco$Rating ~ choco$Location)

```

Here we examine the rating by Location
```{r }
boxplot(choco$Rating ~ choco$Location)

```

```{r }

boxplot(choco$Rating ~ choco$Company)

```


The following is a bar chart of the number of ratings in each year
```{r }
years = table(choco$Date)
barplot(years, main="Number of ratings each year", xlab='Year', ylab='Number of ratings' )

```
